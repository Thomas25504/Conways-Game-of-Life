 Conway's Game of Life is a zero-player game created by mathematician John Conway in 1970. It's a fascinating simulation that models cellular automation â€” a grid of cells that evolve over time based on simple rules.

### Concept
The game is played on a 2D grid where each cell can be in one of two states:
ðŸŸ© Alive (1)
â¬› Dead (0)

Each cell interacts with its eight immediate neighbors (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).

### Rules of the Game
Each cell's fate is determined by these four simple rules:

Underpopulation:
ðŸ”º Any alive cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (loneliness).

Survival:
ðŸ”¹ Any alive cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors continues to live.

Overpopulation:
ðŸ”» Any alive cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overcrowding).

Reproduction:
ðŸŒ± Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive (birth).
